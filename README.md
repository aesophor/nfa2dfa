# regexcpp
C++ regex matching library using finite state automata

**Warning:** This shit is not ready, if you look at the code, you may find it halarious and ridiculous.

What's done:
* FSA (abstract, base class)
* NFA (concrete, derived from FSA)
* DFA (concrete, derived from NFA)
* Print transition table (NFA/DFA)
* NFA -> DFA (epsilon/lambda move isn't implemented yet)
